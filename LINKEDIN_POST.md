**Headline:** Building AI that tunes itself. 🧠

**Post Content:**

I’ve been working on a **Self-Regulating Learning System** where the optimizer isn't static—it adapts to loss dynamics in real-time.

Instead of manually tuning hyperparameters, I built a homeostatic regulator that continuously adjusts the learning rate based on the model's performance error. It perceives high loss as stress and adjusts its strategy to stabilize, much like a biological system.

The prototype includes:
✅ Synthetic Environment Generator (`src/data_generator.py`)
✅ Adaptive Regularization Engine (`src/regulator.py`)
✅ Feedback Loop implementation (`src/main.py`)

This is a step towards **non-stationary learning systems** that can survive in changing environments without human intervention.

Next steps: Extending to non-linear manifolds and theoretical bounds. 📉

Open to research collaboration. 🤝
